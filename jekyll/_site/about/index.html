    <p>Goodreads is the world’s leading social reading and curation site. Its 50
million unique users per month rate and review the books they
read, arranging them on personalized “shelves,” and forming fan clubs,
friend networks, and discussion groups.  It is a site of major importance for
literary reception studies, a field that cuts across the disciplines of
sociology, psychology, and literary studies, and involves scrutiny not (merely)
of works of literature but of the tastes and habits and experiences of actual
readers.  Perhaps the greatest challenge for reception scholars has been the
difficulty of gathering datasets adequately representative of such a vast and
varied field of practice as reading.  The typical procedure has been to
generalize from quite small scale studies of at most a few dozen relatively
homogeneous subjects.  The massive quantity of data about all sorts of readers
and reading contained on the Goodreads site is potentially transformative of the
field.</p>

<p>The Mining Goodreads project at Penn, cosponsored by the Humanities and Human 
Flourishing project and the Price Lab for Digital Humanities, focuses on readers 
of contemporary fiction.  We have built a database comprising nearly three 
million Goodreads reviews, together with corresponding ratings (on a 5-star scale), 
and metadata on the books, authors, and users themselves. We have gathered all the 
reviews of 500 bestsellers and of 1300 novels that made the shortlists of major awards 
since 1960, plus a substantial cross-section of the reviews of curated top-200 lists
of mystery/crime/detective fiction, science fiction, and chick lit/modern
romance novels.  In addition, we have compiled all the reviews written by a random 
set of 1,672 highly active Goodreads users (sampled from all users who had posted 
at least 150 reviews as of January 2018.  Between them these readers have read
more than 200,000 unique works of fiction across the full range of popular and
not-so-popular genres. We have refined and structured this data and developed
quite a lot of code, most of which may be shared with other researchers to help
them pursue their own questions about contemporary readers, tastes, and values.</p>

<p>We have not made use of any information pertaining to users who maintain private
accounts or profiles on Goodreads.  Although the information we have collected
is freely visible to any browser, we have designed our experiments and composed
our outputs so as to ensure the anonymity of all users in our sample.  The User
ID numbers that appear in our Bokeh visualizations are randomly assigned for our
own purposes; they are not actual Goodreads IDs.</p>
